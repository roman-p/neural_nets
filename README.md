# Simple Regression NN

Simple Neural network with one level of neurons, that evaluate the sigmoid function.
Doodling around:)

## Example
See SampleUsage notebook for full detail.

Initialization with
```
n = NeuralNetwork(input_dim, hidden_layer_dim, output_dim)
yHat = n.forward(X)
cost = nn.cost(X, y)
```
